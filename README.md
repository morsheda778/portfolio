👋 Hi, I'm Morsheda Akter  
📊 E-commerce & Retail Data Analyst | 💼 Power BI Specialist | 📈 Business Insights Expert  

Welcome to my portfolio!  
I’m a passionate data analyst who helps eCommerce and retail businesses make better, faster, and smarter decisions with the help of interactive dashboards and analytics. My work focuses on transforming raw business data into visual stories that drive growth and improve customer experience.  

I specialize in **Power BI** and **Excel**, using advanced data modeling, DAX calculations, and visual storytelling to uncover patterns in sales, customer behavior, and product performance. I enjoy working with complex datasets — cleaning, transforming, and turning them into meaningful insights that support business strategies.  

My core areas of expertise include:
- **Sales Analytics:** Tracking daily, monthly, and yearly performance to identify trends and revenue opportunities.  
- **Customer Insights:** Analyzing customer retention, purchase frequency, and segmentation to improve marketing decisions.  
- **Product Performance:** Identifying top-selling and low-performing items to optimize inventory and pricing.  
- **Dashboard Design:** Creating clean, interactive Power BI reports that simplify decision-making.  

I’ve worked on several projects where I visualized end-to-end sales processes — from orders and inventory to profit analysis. My dashboards help stakeholders quickly understand KPIs such as total revenue, conversion rate, average order value, and profit margins.  

I’m constantly learning new tools and techniques to enhance my analytical and visualization skills. My approach is data-driven, detail-oriented, and focused on business outcomes.  

If you’re looking for someone who can combine **analytical thinking** with **visual creativity**, you’re in the right place!
